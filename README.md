# odin-recipes
A Learning Project using HTML

This project will involve building a website for different recipes that will be displayed for users to view and gain information on. It is basically a beginner project so much styling won't be done for user interactions however it may be updated in the future.

This project will build basic HTML and CSS skills that are the two basic foundations of Web development and design.
